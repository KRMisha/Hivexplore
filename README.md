# Hivexplore

The repo is structured as 4 subprojects:
- `client`: the web front-end
- `server`: the back-end server used to communicate with the drone swarm
- `drone`: the drone firmware
- `argos`: the ARGoS simulation used to test the drones

## Usage

To open the repo in VS Code, use the multi-root workspace:
```
code Hivexplore.code-workspace
```

Alternatively, you can double-click on the `Hivexplore.code-workspace` file in your file explorer.

**See each subproject's README for more information.**
